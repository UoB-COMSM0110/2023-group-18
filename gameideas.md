Boxhead-like game - fighting/killing zombies

From Dan: I found several Boxhead-like games, is it a tower defence game and player can control a soldier to shoot zombies?

I figure that a tank war or aircraft war is easier to beginners, but we can do some additional aswsome stuff inside the program which depends on our imagination.
BTWï¼Œ I really dislike Tetris because it is boring, no passion sleepy game. I hope to make some thing let player feel excited!
